Super Key -  A super key is a group of single or multiple keys which identifies rows in a table.
Primary Key -  is a column or group of columns in a table that uniquely identify every row in that table.
Candidate Key -  is a set of attributes that uniquely identify tuples in a table. Candidate Key is a super key with no repeated attributes.
Alternate Key -  is a column or group of columns in a table that uniquely identify every row in that table.
Foreign Key -  is a column that creates a relationship between two tables. The purpose of Foreign keys is 
to maintain data integrity and allow navigation between two different instances of an entity.
Compound Key -  has two or more attributes that allow you to uniquely recognize a specific record. 
It is possible that each column may not be unique by itself within the database.
Composite Key -  An artificial key which aims to uniquely identify each record is called a surrogate key. 
These kind of key are unique because they are created when you don't have any natural primary key.
Surrogate Key -  An artificial key which aims to uniquely identify each record is called a surrogate key.
